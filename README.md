# Practical Perspectives on Variable Selection for Binary Longitudinal Data
Accounting for the correlation among responses is crucial for statistical analysis and reliable inferences in multivariate response data. In areas such as biomedical studies, binary longitudinal data frequently arises. Focusing on this, we review variable selection methods based on GEE, GLMM, Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial and machine learning methods such as random forest and neural networks from a practicality point of view. The implementations as well as computational challenges of these methods in software R are addressed. We study and evaluate our methods first by simulations, and then illustrate them on the microbiome data set.
